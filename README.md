# CNE310_Abi Forking a Repository

In this Project, I want to describe how to Forking a repository GitHub with my python code.
I will add my work (python code) to my partner file.
Usually fork is used to make any changes to someone else's project allows you to make changes without affecting the original project.

## Getting Started

These instructions will download PyCharm on my local machine for and plugin Python.

### Prerequisites

Forking Repository requires Pycharm 2022 version  17.0.4+7-b469.53 amd64. to run, with Python I created a PyCharmProject\CNE310 Repository.py. 
The commands below will: 
Uses a for loop to print all of the words in the list ‘words’ that start with “c”, 
and adds 1 to c_counter. Change the program so that it uses a while loop to complete the same task.

Here is my code the Input:

##My Assignment
words = ["aardvark","cookies","asterisk","cowabunga","gryphon","angular","cringe"]
i = 0
c_counter = 0
while i < len(words):
    if words[i][0] == "c":
        print(words[i])
        c_counter = c_counter + 1
    i += 1

```

## Running
Once installed you can run the program with the following command this will be my output:

cookies
cowabunga
cringe

```
python assignment.py
```

Add any additional ways to run the program below
You can use Visual Code

I do my reseach on Chrome to know more about Forking a resository.
About the python code it is my last assignment In my programming class.
